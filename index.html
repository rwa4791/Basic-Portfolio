<p> <img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/4/005/09f/078/0408833.jpg" align=left> My name is Robert Angus. I was born and raised in Westfield New Jersey. I went to Saint Joseph's University in Phildelphia from 2009 to 2013. I graduated with a History Degree and Business Minor. After college, I decided to go into sales but felt it stifled my creativity. I am looking for opportunties within the coding/web development sector.

 Specifically I will be looking to do website development for freelance opportunity. I will also be looking for chances to develop
 appliciations to help freelancers in the creative sector.</p>
